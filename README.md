# Secure Programming _(CSE4382/CSE5382)_
This class was taken during the Spring of 2021 with Trey Jones at The University of Texas at Arlington.
<h1> Overview of Secure Programming </h1>
This course is an introduction to methods of secure software design and development for upper-level
undergraduate students and graduate students. Students will learn about the major security problems
found in software today. Using this knowledge, they will work to find these bugs in software, fix the bugs,
and design software so that it has fewer security problems. Static analysis tools will be a core part of the
class, but students will also be exposed to black box testing tools. Topics will include input validation,
buffer overflow prevention, error
<b>
<h1> Student Learning Outcomes </h1>
The student should understand the principles necessary to develop secure software within the larger
context of System Security Engineering. In addition, the student will have the opportunity to apply their
understanding of secure software development principles through the use of static code analysis (both
manual and automated) as well as implementation and exploitation of vulnerabilities that are the result of
poor programming practices.
